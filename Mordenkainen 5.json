      "description": "Zuggtmoy's principal lair is her palace on Shedaklah. It consists of two dozen mushrooms of pale yellow and rancid brown. These massive fungi are some of the largest in existence. They are surrounded by a field of acidic puffballs and poisonous vapors. The mushrooms are all interconnected by bridges of shelf-fungi, and countless chambers have been hollowed out inside their rubbery, fibrous stalks.\n<b>Lair Actions.</b>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n• Zuggtmoy causes four gas spores or violet fungi (see the <i>Monster Manual</i>) to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour.\n• Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack.\n• Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores centered on mushrooms or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself.\n<b>Regional Effects.</b>\nThe region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by her magic, creating one or more of the following effects:\n• Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase.\n• Plant life within 1 mile of the lair becomes festered with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed.\n• If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness as determined by the Madness of Zuggtmoy table (see <i>Out of the Abyss</i> or Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes</i>). A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.",
